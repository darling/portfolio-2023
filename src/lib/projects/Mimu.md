Working at Mimu was an incredible experience for me. As a software engineer and community manager, I wore many hats and played a key role in keeping the bot running smoothly.

I worked closely with [Iara](https://iara.works/), the owner of the bot, as well as with mentors who provided invaluable guidance and advice.

## Technical Contributions

One of my key achievements at Mimu was leading the rewrite for the major [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) change, which involved updating the bot to be compatible with the latest version of the platform's API.

I also facilitated the introduction of modern Discord features to the bot and singlehandedly added buttons, forms, and advanced caching to the bot. These were complex tasks that required a great deal of technical expertise and attention to detail, but with the help of my mentors, I was able to implement these features successfully and improve the user experience for Mimu's users.

## Community Management

In addition to my technical work, I was also heavily involved in facilitating events and beta testing for Mimu. This involved working with users to identify bugs and issues, test new features and functionalities, and provide feedback to the development team.

Actively beta testing with 20-50 users at a time allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the bot's features and functionalities, which helped me to provide support and guidance to users.

It creates a stronger community and allows users to feel more connected to the bot and its development.

I enjoyed working directly with users and providing a high level of support and guidance, which helped to ensure that Mimu remained a reliable and user-friendly service for its many users.

## Conclusion

Overall, my time at Mimu was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to gain a deep understanding of how real services and at-scale programs operate.

Whether I was working on complex engineering projects, facilitating events and beta testing, or simply helping to keep things running smoothly, I played a critical role in the current success and growth of Mimu.

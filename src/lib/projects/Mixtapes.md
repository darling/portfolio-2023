MixtapesBut.Digital is a unique website that allows users to turn their Spotify playlists into immutable mixtapes that can only hold 5 songs each. Users can write notes next to each track, but the songs themselves are immutable and replicate the experience of creating and minting an old school cassette tape.

At its core, MixtapesBut.Digital is an art project that examines the relationship between people and music in the modern age. With streaming services and digital downloads, it's easier than ever to access music, but something has been lost in the process. MixtapesBut.Digital aims to recreate the art of mixtapes in the digital age, allowing users to curate and share music in a way that is both personal and meaningful.

## Technical Details

MixtapesBut.Digital is built on top of Spotify's API which allows for the creation of immutable mixtapes that can be shared across the web. Users can log in with their Spotify account, create a new mixtape, and select up to 5 songs to include. They can then write notes next to each track, and mint the mixtape as an immutable object onto our database.

## The Art of Sharing Music

MixtapesBut.Digital is more than just a technical project â€“ it's an exploration of how people share music and connect with each other through music. By limiting the number of songs on each mixtape and making them immutable, MixtapesBut.Digital forces users to curate their selections carefully and create something that is personal and meaningful.

## Overview

Ferris is a cutting-edge moderation bot for the Discord community. Developed with a focus on user experience and fast response time, it is designed to make moderating your server as easy and efficient as possible.

## Technical Details

The bot utilizes a powerful combination of Node.js and Rust for its backend, ensuring that it can handle even the largest and most active servers with ease. The frontend, built using React and Next.js, is both beautiful and intuitive, making it easy for users to access and utilize the bot's many features.

## Features

One of the key features of Ferris is its real-time stats and actions, which are accessible through the bot's robust web panel. This panel allows users to quickly and easily manage their server, with features such as user management, message moderation, and more. Additionally, Ferris is one of the first bots to adopt the modern Discord interaction system, including slash commands, which greatly enhances the overall user experience.

## Notes

Not only is Ferris a functional and user-friendly bot, but it was also a great learning experience for me as a developer. The bot's development process allowed me to learn and work with a variety of modern web development technologies such as Node.js, Rust, React and Next.js.

I am proud to have created a bot that is both useful and innovative, and I am excited to continue to improve and develop Ferris in the future.

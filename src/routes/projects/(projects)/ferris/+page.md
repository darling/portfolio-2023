## Introduction

> Ferris is an old project, many of the screenshots you see are from a postmortem I wrote in 2020. The following is a description of the project and its future goals. Screenshots may be of previous versions of the project, and the project may have changed since the time of writing.

Ferris.gg is not your average Discord bot; it's a premium, managed, and high-caliber solution for community management and moderation. Conceived during the 2020 pandemic, Ferris.gg marks a pivotal point in my journey from a backend and networking stack developer to a fledged web developer. This project revolutionized the Discord bot landscape at the time, providing robust features and a premium web panel, all wrapped in irresistibly cute branding.

## Technological Backbone

Built on a robust stack featuring WebSockets, Discord.js, React, and Next.js, Ferris.gg was engineered for performance and scalability.

At its core, Ferris.gg was designed to set a new standard in Discord bot functionality.

It boasted high-performance features with low tolerance for errors and an impressive low failure rate. But what set Ferris apart was its early adoption of Discord's newly-released features like slash commands and buttons. This proactive approach allowed Ferris.gg to stay ahead of the curve, positioning it as a leading-edge solution in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

## Branding & User Engagement

The playful, yet sophisticated, branding of Ferris.gg played a crucial role in its rapid growth. While tech-centric design often overlooks the power of branding, Ferris.gg proved that a unique and cohesive brand identity could accelerate scale.

The branding was not just "cute"; it was strategically aligned with Discord's own design language, ensuring high cohesion within the platform while leaving a lasting impression on users.

> Ferris actually pivoted as a food themed platform called Shoku!.gg for a while. It was a fun experiment, but it didn't work out. I'm glad I tried it though, it was a fun experience and it inspired the 2023 iteration of Ferris.gg.

## Challenges & Learning

Ferris.gg was a fertile ground for learning and growth, particularly in the realm of complex UI frameworks and modern UI state management. At the time, web panels for Discord bots were relatively primitive.

Ferris.gg aimed to change that by offering features seldom seen in this space. Navigating the challenges of designing and implementing these advanced features was not just a technical hurdle; it was an educational journey that significantly broadened my understanding of web development.

## Impact & Recognition

The bot's impact was both immediate and significant. Ferris.gg experienced rapid growth, gaining thousands of servers virtually overnight. Beyond its user base, the bot caught the attention of industry giants like MEE6, ProBot, and Dyno, as well as platforms like Top.gg and Nookazon. While some were competitors and others supporters, the interest across the board affirmed Ferris.gg as a project worth watching in the Discord bot landscape.

> Retrospectively, Ferris wasn't given enough time to grow by me. It was a project that was shelved in favor of other projects. Looking back, if I stuck with Ferris it would own it's own industry. I'm proud of what I did with Ferris, but I'm also sad that I didn't give it the time it needed to grow.

## Unique Selling Proposition

What truly set Ferris.gg apart was its approach to Discord community management. Unlike other bots that offered a generic set of features, Ferris provided a tailored experience. It combined simple yet robust features with a high degree of configurability.

This made it not just another Discord bot but a platform that was ahead of its time, offering a new perspective on what Discord community management could be.

## Conclusion

Ferris.gg stands as a testament to the power of innovative thinking and strategic execution in a saturated market. Despite its eventual shelving in favor of other ventures, the bot remains a milestone in my career and a disruptor in its domain. It demonstrated that with the right mix of technology, design, and foresight, even a Discord bot could turn heads and redefine standards.

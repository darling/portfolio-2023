As a co-founder of Unworthy, a collective that promotes digital autonomy and privacy, I have been involved in a variety of initiatives that prioritize privacy and security. Our mission is to provide services and resources that help individuals and organizations maintain control over their digital presence.

## What Unworthy Does

At Unworthy, we strongly believe that everyone has the right to privacy and the ability to control their own data. To that end, we self-host a variety of services, including email, file hosting, and communication tools, that are designed to be accessible and easy to use, while also providing a high level of security and control.

## How Unworthy Works

In addition to providing services, we also promote digital autonomy and privacy through education and outreach. We offer resources and guides to help individuals and organizations protect their privacy online.

Overall, my involvement with Unworthy has allowed me to deepen my understanding of digital privacy and autonomy, and to contribute to a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to building a more secure, private, and equitable digital future.

Bruhhouse is a project that I created to develop an HTML editor that could be used by creatives to edit preconfigured HTML templates in real-time using a form. The goal was to make it simple and easy for non-technical users to edit HTML templates without having to know how to code.

## How it Works

The Bruhhouse HTML editor is built using React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The editor allows users to select a preconfigured HTML template from a list of options and then edit the template using a form that includes various input fields such as text, images, and links.

The form updates the HTML code in real-time, so users can see exactly how their changes will look on the webpage. This makes it easy for creatives to experiment with different design options and see how they look in real-time.

## What I Learned

Working on Bruhhouse was a great learning experience for me, as it allowed me to develop my skills in React and technical frontend development. I learned how to work with HTML templates, how to create forms that update HTML code in real-time, and how to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## The Future of Bruhhouse

While I no longer actively work on Bruhhouse, my friend Agnes has taken over the project and continues to maintain and develop it. You can check out the latest version of Bruhhouse on her website, [48n.es](48n.es/projects/safehouse).

Overall, Bruhhouse is a simple yet effective tool that makes it easy for creatives to edit HTML templates in real-time. It's a great example of how technical frontend development can be used to create user-friendly and innovative tools for non-technical users.

## Introduction

![The home page](https://cdn.ey.lc/projects/roadiden/firefox_J39yvEJ42b.gif)

Road Identity was created in a short period to address the immediate needs of 356 Club. It has since become the go-to solution for the club's future events, with plans to expand into the social media market and other automotive ventures.

This platform was used for the Club's July 2023 event with over 200 participants, and the following is a description of the project and its future goals. Screenshots may be of previous versions of the project, and the project may have changed since the time of writing.

RoadIdentity.com is not just another car enthusiast website; it's a groundbreaking car identity management platform tailor-made for car clubs. Currently servicing 356 Club, one of Southern California's largest Porsche car clubs, the platform transcends traditional boundaries. It not only offers a sleek, digital profile for individual cars—complete with history, gallery, and owner details—but also revolutionizes the way car clubs engage in events through a state-of-the-art SMS voting system.

## A Need

The inception of RoadIdentity.com was serendipitous, arising from an immediate need within the 356 Club. Tasked with creating an in-house solution for one of the largest Porsche display events on the West Coast, the platform was built with urgency and purpose. It wasn't a mere experiment; it was a solution to a pressing problem, filling a void that conventional voting systems—often arcane and outdated—could not address.

## Technical Achievements

Built on a robust stack that includes Next.js and PostgreSQL, the technical prowess of RoadIdentity.com is most evident in its SMS voting system.

Partnering with Telnyx, the platform had to overcome significant hurdles to create a voting mechanism that was both accessible, transparent, and legal within the given time constraints.

The system uses QR codes linked to preset SMS texts, making it incredibly user-friendly while ensuring that each vote is contextualized. This brings a modern touch to an experience that has often relied on more traditional, and less efficient, methods.

## User Experience & Design

RoadIdentity.com aims to elevate the user experience from the ground up.

The digital profiles for cars are designed to be straightforward yet comprehensive, featuring everything from the vehicle's history to a visual gallery. Employees and Volunteers would **edit profiles for the club members via an admin panel**, which was designed to be intuitive and easy to use. In the future, the platform will allow users to edit their profiles directly, further streamlining the process.

On the voting side, the platform has simplified an often cumbersome process. By using QR codes and SMS, RoadIdentity.com has made voting not just easier but also more engaging, fulfilling the needs of both event organizers and participants.

## Reception

In a short period, RoadIdentity.com has become the go-to voting solution for 356 Club's future events. Its impact has not only been logistical but also cultural, breathing new life into the way car clubs interact and engage during events. With plans to expand into the social media market and other automotive ventures, RoadIdentity.com is poised to redefine what it means to have a "car identity" in the digital age.
